# Getting Started with Python

## Why Python? (The Lowdown)

Alright, so Python is basically this super popular coding language. It's awesome because it's really easy to read â€“ seriously, the code looks almost like normal English. Plus, it's pretty simple to pick up, and you can use it for loads of stuff. Think making websites, diving into data, or even just automating boring tasks so you don't have to do them.

Understanding where Python came from and what makes it tick is your first big step in learning how to code!
