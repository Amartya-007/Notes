# Java Learning Path

Welcome to the Java Learning Path! This repository contains notes organized to guide you through Java programming, from fundamental concepts to advanced topics, including Data Structures & Algorithms and essential Build Tools.

## Repository Structure

The learning materials are structured into the following main directories:

```code
/basic          - Core Java Fundamentals
/intermediate   - Intermediate Java Concepts
/advanced       - Advanced Java Topics
/DSA            - Data Structures and Algorithms
/build_tools    - Build Tools and Development Environment
```

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Start with the Basics**: If you are new to Java, begin with the [[basic/01_java_syntax.md|Basic Java]] module.
2. **Progress Sequentially**: Follow the modules in an order that suits your learning goals (e.g., Basic -> Intermediate -> Advanced).
3. **Explore DSA**: Concurrently or after covering basics, dive into [[DSA/01_basic_data_structures.md|Data Structures & Algorithms]].
4. **Understand Tools**: Familiarize yourself with [[build_tools/01_maven_gradle.md|Build Tools & Environment]] as they are crucial for development.
5. **Read the Notes**: Each link points to a Markdown file with detailed explanations and "Key Knowledge Points".
6. **Practice**: Apply the concepts learned through coding exercises (if available elsewhere or self-directed).
