## 🧠 Key Concepts First

| Term        | Meaning                                                                                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API Request | A message sent to a server asking it to do something (GET data, send data, update data). |
| Endpoint    | A URL where the server listens for incoming requests (e.g., /users).                     |
| Method      | The action you're taking (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).                                       |
| Params      | Extra info you attach to your request to filter or control behavior.                     |
| Headers     | Metadata for the server (e.g., content type, authorization tokens).                      |
| Body        | The data you send with the request (only for POST, PUT, PATCH, etc.).                    |

## 🧱 Step-by-Step Guide: Send Your First API Request

### Step 1: Open Postman and click on "New" → "HTTP Request"
- You can also click ➕ at the top left.
- Or inside a collection, click "Add a request[^1]".

💡 Pro Tip: Always save your request inside a Collection so you don’t lose it.

---

### Step 2: Select the HTTP Method
- Default is GET.
- Click the dropdown next to it to choose:
  - GET → Fetch data
  - POST → Send new data
  - PUT → Update entire data
  - PATCH → Update part of the data
  - DELETE → Remove data

✅ Choose GET for now.

---

### Step 3: Enter the Request URL (Endpoint)
Try this public API:

```

[https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts)

```

ℹ️ This API gives fake blog posts (used for learning and testing).

---

### Step 4: Click Send
Postman will:

- Send a request to the server
- Show the response in the bottom center panel

You’ll see:
- Response body (JSON)
- Status code (200 OK)
- Time taken
- Size of response

🎉 Congrats — you just hit an API like a pro!

|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| URL Field           | The API endpoint you’re calling                             |
| Method Dropdown     | GET/POST/etc.                                               |
| Params/Header Tabs  | Add extra filters or authentication                         |
| Body Tab            | For sending JSON (used in POST/PUT)                         |
| Send Button         | Fires the request                                           |
| Response Viewer     | Shows data from the server                                  |

## 🧠 Common Beginner Mistakes

❌ Forgetting to choose the correct HTTP method  
❌ Trying to send a body with a GET request (only works with POST/PUT/PATCH)  
❌ Using incorrect endpoint URLs or misspelling them  
❌ Forgetting to set headers like Content-Type when sending JSON

---

## 🛠️ Bonus Tip: Save Your Request

After sending it:

- Click Save
- Name your request (e.g., Get Blog Posts)
- Add a description if you want (useful for teams)
- Save it inside a Collection

This way, you can reuse and organize your API tests.

---

## 🔁 Practice Challenge (For You)

Try hitting this endpoint:
```

[https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users)

```
- What kind of data does it return?
- What’s the status code?
- Can you guess what each field means?
