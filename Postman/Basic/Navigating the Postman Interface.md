You are looking at the default layout of Postman when you first open it. Here's what everything means in your screenshot:

---

## 🧱 Left Sidebar — Navigation Hub

This is your main toolbox.

| Icon         | Section         | Purpose                                                                 |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 📁           | Collections       | Organize saved requests. You can create folders and group related APIs. |
| 🌐           | Environments      | Store variables (like base URLs, tokens). Use for switching between dev/stage/prod. |
| 🔁           | Flows             | Visual tool for chaining API requests (optional, more advanced).       |
| 🕓           | History           | Shows all your past requests — click to reuse or inspect them.         |
| 🔲           | APIs              | Manage your full API spec using OpenAPI, GraphQL, etc. (optional).     |

📌 Your screenshot is currently highlighting:
Collections → With a big button prompting you to "Create Collection"
